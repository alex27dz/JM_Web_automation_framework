WHAT WILL IT COST ME?
How the Jewelry Insurance Experts Compare to the Big Names
Jewelry is typically covered under renters and homeowners insurance policies. But that coverage is not usually enough to cover
the full replacement cost, and even a jewelry-specific rider added to your homeowners policy has its limits.
See How We Compare Jewelers Mutual Group Typical Homeowners Typical Rider
Loss
Theft
Damage Not always covered Not always covered
Disappearance
Flood or Earthquake Not always covered Not always covered
Worldwide Travel
Out-of-Pocket Cost $0 deductible option Homeowners deductible applies May have a deductible
The Risks of Adding Jewelry to Homeowners
Insuring jewelry with a standalone policy protects your home insurance from the effects of a jewelry claim.
The Risks of Adding Jewelry to Homeowners
Insuring jewelry with a standalone policy protects your home insurance from the effects of a jewelry claim.
What does jewelry insurance cover?
We provide all types of jewelry insurance, including engagement ring insurance. Watches, earrings, and even loose stones while being set - yep, we cover those too.
No matter the type of jewelry you insure, it&amp;#39;ll be protected by our comprehensive repair or replacement coverage. Plus, your coverage includes worldwide travel.
Loss
You left your ring somewhere—on a beach towel or in a public bathroom. It’s out there somewhere and you can’t find it. It’s covered.
Theft
We all know that feeling of dread when something we cherish is stolen. But you can rest assured that your stolen piece is covered, too.
Damage
You hit your diamond ring on the edge of a table and it cracks, or you&amp;#39;re pulling on a sweater and a prong is bent. Accidents happen. We&amp;#39;ll cover that.
Disappearance
Sometimes jewelry just disappears—it could be lost, stolen or hanging out in a drainpipe somewhere. You may not be able to explain how, where or when it vanished. Don’t worry, that’s covered.
Protecting All Things Jewelry Since 1913
Jewelry insurance is only as good as the company standing behind it. Protect yours with the only insurer in North America solely dedicated to jewelry insurance for over 100 years.

Jewelry Insurance Claims
START A CLAIM
You can also file a claim by logging in to your account or calling us at 888-884-2424.
Jewelry Insurance Claims
START A CLAIM
You can also file a claim by logging in to your account or calling us at 888-884-2424.
What&amp;#39;s Needed
When your jewelry is damaged, lost or stolen, all you want is to get it back, just the way it was. To help us get you there as fast as possible,
prepare the following before you start your claim. If any additional documentation is needed, your claims representative will let you know.
Proof of Ownership
Any documentation, like a receipt, appraisal or dated photo of the jewelry, that proves it&amp;#39;s yours.
Written Statement
A short statement explaining what happened, including a list of damage if your jewelry wasn&amp;#39;t lost or stolen entirely.
Police Report
A police report, depending on the jewelry and how it was lost or stolen. We&amp;#39;ll let you know if it&amp;#39;s needed.
COVID-19 and Your Claim
If you need to submit a claim or have a claim in progress, we ask for your patience during this difficult time. We are working hard to limit disruptions to our policyholders.
Many jewelers have been mandated to shut down due to shelter-in-place orders intended to slow the spread of COVID-19. This may cause a delay by your jeweler to fulfill claim-related work.
We will work with you to ensure we have all necessary information to start your claim and proceed as quickly as possible when your jeweler reopens. Thank you for your understanding.
How It All Works
Our goal is to repair or replace jewelry with same kind and quality as fast as possible. We partner directly with
your jeweler to handle the repair or replacement and the transaction. Here&amp;#39;s what the process typically looks like:
1
Start Your Claim
Let us know what happened.
Start your claim online, or call us at 888-884-2424.
2
Choose a Jeweler
Choose a jeweler to repair or replace your item.
Once you get the okay from us, head to your jeweler. If you&amp;#39;re not sure who to use, we can help find a jeweler near you.
3
Pay Your Deductible
If your policy has a deductible, pay that amount to your jeweler.
The jeweler will bill us for the rest. (If you have a $0 deductible, and the cost of replacement isn&amp;#39;t more than you insured yours for, you pay nothing. All you have to do is pick up your jewelry, good as new!)
4
Insure Your Replacement Jewelry
If your jewelry was replaced entirely, we&amp;#39;ll help you add that to your policy.
If your jewelry was simply repaired back to its original state, there&amp;#39;s nothing more for you to do!

Care Plans for Jewelry and Watches
While most store warranties cover only manufacturers’ defects, JM Care Plan helps your customer keep their jewelry or watch in like-new condition by covering normal wear and tear, and accidental damage.
JM Care Plan can be offered to your customers at the time of jewelry or watch purchase.
 
How It Works
This is a care plan from the experts. Because it’s not insurance, you can offer it directly to your customers at the time of a jewelry or watch sale.
Offer JM Care Plan on every sale by including it:
as an additional benefit with a sale
in the price of a jewelry quote
JM Care Plan is part of the Zing® platform. Use the platform to file claims for your customers, generate sales reports and track revenue earned.
True Care plans video modal is displayed
Customer Satisfaction
A sure way to satisfy your customers is by letting them know their jewelry is covered from damage caused by normal wear and that it will stay looking like new.
Value
Bring extra value and profit to your business while also offering value to your customer with an affordable care plan.
Convenience
A quick, easy, no-fault claim process makes repair or replacement as easy as possible for your customers. No out-of-pocket expenses are expected from your customers or your business.
Customer Loyalty
Each care plan keeps your customers coming back to your store for jewelry care and claims while enhancing the in-store customer repair experience.
Increase Sales
Increase your average sale without inventory investment. Offering a care plan adds bottom-line profit to every eligible sale.
Competition
Selling care plans helps your business compete in a crowded industry and assists in brand promotion. A care plan provides your customers with nationwide coverage.

Band Together Campaign
We are passionate about supporting worthy organizations. That’s why we selected three, national non-profits to join us in our Band Together campaign.
This campaign encourages our policyholders to vote for a non-profit they feel most strongly about. Read more about our 2020 Charitable Giving Campaign.
Kids In Need Foundation
Our support for Kids in Need Foundation has supplied 2,000 students with backpacks, each filled with essential supplies for the 2020-2021 school year.
Kids In Need Foundation believes every child in America should have equal opportunity and access to a quality education.
Through its programs and National Network of Resource Centers, KINF serves an estimated 5 million students, 200,000 teachers, and provides over $100 million in product at no cost to schools or teachers, empowering teachers to teach and learners to learn.
Feeding America®
In 2020, we donated 1,940,000 meals* to Feeding America®.
Feeding America® seeks to feed America’s hungry through a nationwide network of member food banks and engage our country in the fight to end hunger.
*$1 helps provide at least 10 meals secured by Feeding America® on behalf of local member food banks.
Stand Up To Cancer
Our support to Stand Up To Cancer has funded 1,950 scientists from 210 institutions, 180+ cancer clinical trials involving 12,000+ patients and helped support research for 9 FDA approvals for new cancer therapies.
Stand Up To Cancer’s (SU2C) mission is to raise funds to accelerate the pace of groundbreaking translational research that can get new therapies to patients quickly and save lives now.

Supply A Teacher
In 2020, we were the national presenting sponsor for Kids in Need Foundation’s Supply A Teacher program, which donates supply boxes to qualifying teachers.

Nearly 1,000 Supply A Teacher boxes had been distributed nationwide by the Kids in Need Foundation in 2020.

Strengthening the Jewelry Industry
We invest significantly in organizations and tools that benefit the jewelry industry.
Our jewelry business policyholders enjoy free membership in the Jeweler Security Alliance loss prevention organization and access to our online trainings that encourage their continued education.
Additionally, we support organizations that promote ethical business practices, like American Gem Society and Jewelers of America.
True Strengthening the Jewelry Industry image is displayed.
Helping Our Employees Help Others
Encouraging and supporting our employees to be socially responsible and involved in our community is a top priority. We can do so much more together.
Gift Match
Our employees are generous givers. The company amplifies this generosity by matching their charitable donations 50%, to any eligible non-profit, nationwide.
Volunteer Hours
All employees are given 12 paid volunteer hours each year and are encouraged to volunteer either individually or as a group through company-organized events.
Charitable Giving Committee
Our corporate gifting initiatives are employee-lead through a cross-functional team that meets quarterly. The committee decides where our local philanthropic efforts are directed and assures each donation provides a positive impact on our community.
Department Efforts
Individual departments are empowered to and often organize their own charitable initiatives above and beyond what the company sponsors. During the holidays you’ll often see department food drives, coat drives or Adopt-A-Family programs popping up across the company.
Scholarships
Our employees’ children are eligible to apply for educational scholarships each year. We also sponsor various jewelry industry scholarships and training through the  Community Foundation for the Fox Valley Region.
Learn More About Us
While our community contributions are a big deal, it’s also important to know our history and a little bit about who we are and where we came from. Learn more on the About Us page.

WHAT WILL IT COST ME?
How the Jewelry Insurance Experts Compare to the Big Names
Jewelry is typically covered under renters and homeowners insurance policies. But that coverage is not usually enough to cover
the full replacement cost, and even a jewelry-specific rider added to your homeowners policy has its limits.
See How We Compare Jewelers Mutual Group Typical Homeowners Typical Rider
Loss
Theft
Damage Not always covered Not always covered
Disappearance
Flood or Earthquake Not always covered Not always covered
Worldwide Travel
Out-of-Pocket Cost $0 deductible option Homeowners deductible applies May have a deductible
The Risks of Adding Jewelry to Homeowners
Insuring jewelry with a standalone policy protects your home insurance from the effects of a jewelry claim.
The Risks of Adding Jewelry to Homeowners
Insuring jewelry with a standalone policy protects your home insurance from the effects of a jewelry claim.
What does jewelry insurance cover?
We provide all types of jewelry insurance, including engagement ring insurance. Watches, earrings, and even loose stones while being set - yep, we cover those too.
No matter the type of jewelry you insure, it&amp;#39;ll be protected by our comprehensive repair or replacement coverage. Plus, your coverage includes worldwide travel.
Loss
You left your ring somewhere—on a beach towel or in a public bathroom. It’s out there somewhere and you can’t find it. It’s covered.
Theft
We all know that feeling of dread when something we cherish is stolen. But you can rest assured that your stolen piece is covered, too.
Damage
You hit your diamond ring on the edge of a table and it cracks, or you&amp;#39;re pulling on a sweater and a prong is bent. Accidents happen. We&amp;#39;ll cover that.
Disappearance
Sometimes jewelry just disappears—it could be lost, stolen or hanging out in a drainpipe somewhere. You may not be able to explain how, where or when it vanished. Don’t worry, that’s covered.
Protecting All Things Jewelry Since 1913
Jewelry insurance is only as good as the company standing behind it. Protect yours with the only insurer in North America solely dedicated to jewelry insurance for over 100 years.

Jewelry Insurance Claims
START A CLAIM
You can also file a claim by logging in to your account or calling us at 888-884-2424.
What&amp;#39;s Needed
When your jewelry is damaged, lost or stolen, all you want is to get it back, just the way it was. To help us get you there as fast as possible,
prepare the following before you start your claim. If any additional documentation is needed, your claims representative will let you know.
Proof of Ownership
Any documentation, like a receipt, appraisal or dated photo of the jewelry, that proves it&amp;#39;s yours.
Written Statement
A short statement explaining what happened, including a list of damage if your jewelry wasn&amp;#39;t lost or stolen entirely.
Police Report
A police report, depending on the jewelry and how it was lost or stolen. We&amp;#39;ll let you know if it&amp;#39;s needed.
COVID-19 and Your Claim
If you need to submit a claim or have a claim in progress, we ask for your patience during this difficult time. We are working hard to limit disruptions to our policyholders.
Many jewelers have been mandated to shut down due to shelter-in-place orders intended to slow the spread of COVID-19. This may cause a delay by your jeweler to fulfill claim-related work.
We will work with you to ensure we have all necessary information to start your claim and proceed as quickly as possible when your jeweler reopens. Thank you for your understanding.
How It All Works
Our goal is to repair or replace jewelry with same kind and quality as fast as possible. We partner directly with
your jeweler to handle the repair or replacement and the transaction. Here&amp;#39;s what the process typically looks like:
1
Start Your Claim
Let us know what happened.
Start your claim online, or call us at 888-884-2424.
2
Choose a Jeweler
Choose a jeweler to repair or replace your item.
Once you get the okay from us, head to your jeweler. If you&amp;#39;re not sure who to use, we can help find a jeweler near you.
3
Pay Your Deductible
If your policy has a deductible, pay that amount to your jeweler.
The jeweler will bill us for the rest. (If you have a $0 deductible, and the cost of replacement isn&amp;#39;t more than you insured yours for, you pay nothing. All you have to do is pick up your jewelry, good as new!)
4
Insure Your Replacement Jewelry
If your jewelry was replaced entirely, we&amp;#39;ll help you add that to your policy.
If your jewelry was simply repaired back to its original state, there&amp;#39;s nothing more for you to do!
What&amp;#39;s Needed
When your jewelry is damaged, lost or stolen, all you want is to get it back, just the way it was. To help us get you there as fast as possible,
prepare the following before you start your claim. If any additional documentation is needed, your claims representative will let you know.

3
Pay Your Deductible
If your policy has a deductible, pay that amount to your jeweler.
The jeweler will bill us for the rest. (If you have a $0 deductible, and the cost of replacement isn&amp;#39;t more than you insured yours for, you pay nothing. All you have to do is pick up your jewelry, good as new!)
4
Insure Your Replacement Jewelry
If your jewelry was replaced entirely, we&amp;#39;ll help you add that to your policy.
If your jewelry was simply repaired back to its original state, there&amp;#39;s nothing more for you to do!

WHAT WILL IT COST ME?
How the Jewelry Insurance Experts Compare to the Big Names
Jewelry is typically covered under renters and homeowners insurance policies. But that coverage is not usually enough to cover
the full replacement cost, and even a jewelry-specific rider added to your homeowners policy has its limits.
See How We Compare Jewelers Mutual Group Typical Homeowners Typical Rider
Loss
Theft
Damage Not always covered Not always covered
Disappearance
Flood or Earthquake Not always covered Not always covered
Worldwide Travel
Out-of-Pocket Cost $0 deductible option Homeowners deductible applies May have a deductible
The Risks of Adding Jewelry to Homeowners
Insuring jewelry with a standalone policy protects your home insurance from the effects of a jewelry claim.
The Risks of Adding Jewelry to Homeowners
Insuring jewelry with a standalone policy protects your home insurance from the effects of a jewelry claim.
What does jewelry insurance cover?
We provide all types of jewelry insurance, including engagement ring insurance. Watches, earrings, and even loose stones while being set - yep, we cover those too.
No matter the type of jewelry you insure, it&amp;#39;ll be protected by our comprehensive repair or replacement coverage. Plus, your coverage includes worldwide travel.
Loss
You left your ring somewhere—on a beach towel or in a public bathroom. It’s out there somewhere and you can’t find it. It’s covered.
Theft
We all know that feeling of dread when something we cherish is stolen. But you can rest assured that your stolen piece is covered, too.
Damage
You hit your diamond ring on the edge of a table and it cracks, or you&amp;#39;re pulling on a sweater and a prong is bent. Accidents happen. We&amp;#39;ll cover that.
Disappearance
Sometimes jewelry just disappears—it could be lost, stolen or hanging out in a drainpipe somewhere. You may not be able to explain how, where or when it vanished. Don’t worry, that’s covered.
Protecting All Things Jewelry Since 1913
Jewelry insurance is only as good as the company standing behind it. Protect yours with the only insurer in North America solely dedicated to jewelry insurance for over 100 years.

Jewelry Insurance Claims
START A CLAIM
You can also file a claim by logging in to your account or calling us at 888-884-2424.
Jewelry Insurance Claims
START A CLAIM
You can also file a claim by logging in to your account or calling us at 888-884-2424.
What&amp;#39;s Needed
When your jewelry is damaged, lost or stolen, all you want is to get it back, just the way it was. To help us get you there as fast as possible,
prepare the following before you start your claim. If any additional documentation is needed, your claims representative will let you know.
Proof of Ownership
Any documentation, like a receipt, appraisal or dated photo of the jewelry, that proves it&amp;#39;s yours.
Written Statement
A short statement explaining what happened, including a list of damage if your jewelry wasn&amp;#39;t lost or stolen entirely.
Police Report
A police report, depending on the jewelry and how it was lost or stolen. We&amp;#39;ll let you know if it&amp;#39;s needed.
COVID-19 and Your Claim
If you need to submit a claim or have a claim in progress, we ask for your patience during this difficult time. We are working hard to limit disruptions to our policyholders.
Many jewelers have been mandated to shut down due to shelter-in-place orders intended to slow the spread of COVID-19. This may cause a delay by your jeweler to fulfill claim-related work.
We will work with you to ensure we have all necessary information to start your claim and proceed as quickly as possible when your jeweler reopens. Thank you for your understanding.
How It All Works
Our goal is to repair or replace jewelry with same kind and quality as fast as possible. We partner directly with
your jeweler to handle the repair or replacement and the transaction. Here&amp;#39;s what the process typically looks like:
1
Start Your Claim
Let us know what happened.
Start your claim online, or call us at 888-884-2424.
2
Choose a Jeweler
Choose a jeweler to repair or replace your item.
Once you get the okay from us, head to your jeweler. If you&amp;#39;re not sure who to use, we can help find a jeweler near you.
3
Pay Your Deductible
If your policy has a deductible, pay that amount to your jeweler.
The jeweler will bill us for the rest. (If you have a $0 deductible, and the cost of replacement isn&amp;#39;t more than you insured yours for, you pay nothing. All you have to do is pick up your jewelry, good as new!)
4
Insure Your Replacement Jewelry
If your jewelry was replaced entirely, we&amp;#39;ll help you add that to your policy.
If your jewelry was simply repaired back to its original state, there&amp;#39;s nothing more for you to do!

True JM Care Plan image is displayed
Care Plans for Jewelry and Watches
While most store warranties cover only manufacturers’ defects, JM Care Plan helps your customer keep their jewelry or watch in like-new condition by covering normal wear and tear, and accidental damage.
JM Care Plan can be offered to your customers at the time of jewelry or watch purchase.
 
How It Works
This is a care plan from the experts. Because it’s not insurance, you can offer it directly to your customers at the time of a jewelry or watch sale.
Offer JM Care Plan on every sale by including it:
as an additional benefit with a sale
in the price of a jewelry quote
JM Care Plan is part of the Zing® platform. Use the platform to file claims for your customers, generate sales reports and track revenue earned.
True Care plans video modal is displayed
Customer Satisfaction
A sure way to satisfy your customers is by letting them know their jewelry is covered from damage caused by normal wear and that it will stay looking like new.
Value
Bring extra value and profit to your business while also offering value to your customer with an affordable care plan.
Convenience
A quick, easy, no-fault claim process makes repair or replacement as easy as possible for your customers. No out-of-pocket expenses are expected from your customers or your business.
Customer Loyalty
Each care plan keeps your customers coming back to your store for jewelry care and claims while enhancing the in-store customer repair experience.
Increase Sales
Increase your average sale without inventory investment. Offering a care plan adds bottom-line profit to every eligible sale.
Competition
Selling care plans helps your business compete in a crowded industry and assists in brand promotion. A care plan provides your customers with nationwide coverage.

5-Step Rooftop Burglary Procedure Criminals Use &amp;amp; What You Can Do to Stop Them
Posted by Jessica Thomaschefsky on May 17, 2021 11:30 AM
In 2019, the Jewelers Security Alliance received reports of 34 rooftop burglaries from 15 states, compared to 9 rooftop burglaries from seven states in 2018. In some cases, alarm systems, often without line security, were compromised. In others, when police responded to alarm signals, they were unable to detect any obvious signs of a break-in upon exterior inspection. Because they were unable to conduct an immediate internal search, it’s likely the burglars had either left the scene, were still inside the building, or on the roof.

Jewelry Store Burglary Prevention: Overcome Obstacles at Closing Time
Posted by Logan Moore on Mar 29, 2021 9:01 AM
Three-minute burglaries continue to impact jewelers who don&amp;#39;t adopt proper closing procedures.
Blanketing something over showcases isn&amp;#39;t fooling criminals who repeatedly case jewelry businesses and are relentless in targeting items of significant value like luxury watches.

Helping Our Employees Help Others
Encouraging and supporting our employees to be socially responsible and involved in our community is a top priority. We can do so much more together.
Gift Match
Our employees are generous givers. The company amplifies this generosity by matching their charitable donations 50%, to any eligible non-profit, nationwide.
Volunteer Hours
All employees are given 12 paid volunteer hours each year and are encouraged to volunteer either individually or as a group through company-organized events.
Charitable Giving Committee
Our corporate gifting initiatives are employee-lead through a cross-functional team that meets quarterly. The committee decides where our local philanthropic efforts are directed and assures each donation provides a positive impact on our community.
Department Efforts
Individual departments are empowered to and often organize their own charitable initiatives above and beyond what the company sponsors. During the holidays you’ll often see department food drives, coat drives or Adopt-A-Family programs popping up across the company.
Scholarships
Our employees’ children are eligible to apply for educational scholarships each year. We also sponsor various jewelry industry scholarships and training through the  Community Foundation for the Fox Valley Region.

While our community contributions are a big deal, it’s also important to know our history and a little bit about who we are and where we came from. Learn more on the About Us page.

FOR SMART, STYLISH JEWELRY LOVERS EVERYWHERE
The Jewelry Box Blog
Looking for an exact price list for resizing a ring? You won&amp;#39;t find that here. Or likely anywhere. And here&amp;#39;s why:
Jewelers must consider numerous factors when determining ring resizing cost, as each element affects the materials needed and the time and effort of the procedure. Read on to learn what affects the cost of resizing a ring.
How Much Does it Cost to Resize a Ring?
It could be $20 to resize a ring. Or it could be hundreds of dollars. To resize a ring by a jeweler, the cost depends on:
How much bigger or smaller it needs to be
What metal it&amp;#39;s made of
How much metal needs to be manipulated
How the stones and design elements of the ring will affect the new shape
Find out what size ring you actually need with a printable ring sizer.
Sizing a Ring Down vs. Up
Making a ring smaller will almost always cost less than making it larger because there are no costs for added materials. To make a ring smaller, jewelers typically:
Cut the band in the back.
Remove the necessary amount of metal.
Solder the two pieces back together.
To make a ring size larger, jewelers can either:
Stretch the metal (which many do not recommend in any situation).
Cut the band and create a bridge of additional metal to re-join the pieces.
The amount of extra material needed directly affects the overall price.
  Pro Tip: &amp;quot;Don’t resize your ring too often! Your finger can change as much as a half size from day-to-day.&amp;quot; - Ben, J. Anthony Jewelers 
Types of Ring Metals
In order of least expensive to impossible, here&amp;#39;s how various fine metals fall on the cost spectrum of resizing a ring:
Yellow gold - One of the easier metals to resize. Yellow gold is the most inexpensive comparably speaking, but gold prices can be volatile.
Sterling silver - Fairly easy to resize. The ability to resize this medal is comparable to yellow gold.
White gold - Requires refinishing and a reapplication of rhodium plating (applied to retain the white gold color).
Rose gold - Very temperamental and can crack during resizing.
Platinum - Requires its own tools for resizing. Platinum has a higher melting point than gold, which can create more work.
Titanium - Extremely hard to work with. Some jewelers are not able to resize titanium rings.
Tungsten - Tungsten rings are too hard to be resized.
Find out how much it costs to insure a ring, too.
Ring Thickness
This one&amp;#39;s simple. The thicker the ring, the higher the price of the resize. More ring = more material. 
Pro Tip: &amp;quot;See a jeweler with the exact ring you want in order to size it correctly, because a wide band will fit tighter than a thinner band.&amp;quot; - Kim, Dream Jewelers
The width of the band isn&amp;#39;t the only thing that can contribute to its thickness, though.
Does your ring have a flat bottom? This is called a european - or euro - shank. Many people like it because it reduces the ability of your ring to spin on your finger. In the case of resizing, a euro shank does add to the cost because the corners add more metal weight.
Additional Stones
The number, type and location of the stones in a ring will all affect the cost to resize.
More stones, more problems - or at least the potential for more problems. The more stones a ring features, the more likely some will need to be moved or adjusted to accommodate the increase or decrease in band.
If diamonds, or other gemstones, are set along the side of a ring that needs to be sized smaller, they will need to be retightened, or even reset, because of the change in curvature.
Some types of gems are temperature sensitive, and those will need to be removed and reset.
If one or more of these conditions applies to your ring, your ring resizing cost will increase.
Where to Get a Ring Resized
If your ring needs resizing, it&amp;#39;s best to get that taken care of by a jeweler, even if it costs you a pretty penny.
No matter how it costs to get a ring resized, it will be cheaper than having to replace the entire piece if it falls off from being too loose or has to get cut off from being too tight.
Unsure if your ring fits properly? (It&amp;#39;s not as obvious as you think. Most men tend to wear their rings too loose because they aren&amp;#39;t used to the feeling of a slightly snug, properly fitting ring.) Take it to your jeweler. They want you to feel secure wearing your rings and will be glad to evaluate your fit. Find out what size you really are with this printable ring sizer!

    There are so many benefits of a insurance policy through Jewelers Mutual, but don&amp;#39;t just take it from us! Check out what our policyholders have to say.

FOR SMART, STYLISH JEWELRY LOVERS EVERYWHERE
The Jewelry Box Blog
When cleaning jewelry at home, the simplest method with the least amount of ingredients is always the safest. However, there are more specific ways you can clean your jewelry, depending on its qualities. Since gold jewelry is so popular, let’s review how to clean gold jewelry in between visits to your jeweler.
Properties of Gold Jewelry
Pure gold is always 24 karat gold. If your piece is less than 24 karats, this indicates it’s mixed with other metals – called alloys – to increase its hardness and durability. This is not necessarily a bad thing. The more active your lifestyle, the less pure gold you’ll want in your jewelry. Gold is a soft metal and is prone to scratching, so mixing it with 10 or more parts alloy will increase its longevity.
Want to know all the cleaning &amp;amp; care advice from our jewelry experts?
How to Clean Gold Jewelry
A jewelry cleaning solution specifically created for gold is a safe and effective way to keep your gold in tip-top shape. Just make sure it indicates gold as an intended use!
Without any commercial products, you can clean your gold jewelry at home following these simple steps:
1. Mix a bit of Dawn dish detergent in warm, not hot, water.
2. Add a few drops of ammonia.
3. Carefully brush with a new, baby-size soft toothbrush.
4. Place in lukewarm water to rinse.
5. Air dry or carefully towel-dry with paper towel or regular cloth.
Remember: gold is a soft metal. Be gentle during the brushing and drying processes.
Hazards to Avoid When Cleaning Gold Jewelry
Because of gold jewelry’s high chance of tarnish*, there are a couple specific substances to avoid:
Soap – Steer clear of any soap with unknown ingredients. Basic blue Dawn dish soap is fine, but remove your gold jewelry before showering to avoid accumulating a film from other body washes.
Chlorine – Chlorine, especially at high temperatures like in a hot tub, can permanently damage or discolor your gold jewelry. Remember to remove it when cleaning with chlorine bleach, too!
*While pure gold does not tarnish, almost all gold jewelry is an alloy, as mentioned above. Depending on the percentage of other metals mixed with the gold, there is chance for tarnish. Better safe than sorry!
Gold Jewelry with Colored Gemstones
Due to the characteristics of many colored gemstones, we advise asking your jeweler about the safest at-home cleaning method for any pieces with stones other than pure diamonds. Many natural gemstones are treated or enhanced after extraction, impacting how you should clean your jewelry.
If you need a quick polish before you’ll have a chance to visit your jeweler, skip the ammonia and give your piece a quick dip in the soap and water mixture. This method is safe for almost all colored stone jewelry.
Visiting Your Jeweler
While the method described above is the best way to clean your gold jewelry at home, there’s no substitute for visiting your jeweler for a professional cleaning.
Your jeweler will know the proper procedures depending on the specific type of gemstone and metal, as well as check your item over for any damage. We always recommend a semi-annual visit to your local jeweler!

FOR SMART, STYLISH JEWELRY LOVERS EVERYWHERE
The Jewelry Box Blog
First things first. There should be no difference between a &amp;quot;jewelry appraisal for insurance&amp;quot; and any other type of jewelry appraisal.
All too often, jewelers hear, &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t want to pay a lot for an appraisal. I only need it to get my jewelry insured.&amp;quot;
Shelling out your hard-earned cash for something intangible, that you will hopefully never use, is never fun. However, there is no point in paying for your insurance if it will leave you hanging when you actually need it - all because you didn&amp;#39;t want to pay more than the minimum to get an accurate, thorough appraisal.
The Importance of Jewelry Appraisals for Insurance
Any time you insure something, you need proof of the item&amp;#39;s value and characteristics in order to replace it, whether with a same kind and quality equivalent or cash. In the case of jewelry, if you have an inaccurate appraisal, you may not recover enough funds from an insurance claim to actually replace your piece at fair market prices.
If you have an incomplete jewelry appraisal, what you know to be your cherished jewelry may not be how the insurer interprets the brief description of your piece.
Either way, you can wind up without an equal replacement for the jewelry you&amp;#39;ve been paying premiums to insure year after year. Kind of defeats the purpose, right?
Bonus: during the appraisal, many jewelry appraisers examine your jewelry for loose diamonds or stones, so that you can fix the issue before losing anything.
Typical Jewelry Appraisal Costs
Now that you understand the importance of an accurate, thorough appraisal, let&amp;#39;s discuss the fees associated with such.
Start with the structure of the fee. Appraisal fees should never be based on a percentage of the jewelry&amp;#39;s value. This is an ethical violation since the appraiser will make more money by valuing a piece higher, leaving incentive to over-inflate. Appraisal services should always be charged by the hour or a flat fee per piece.
Hourly rates typically range from $50 to $150, depending on the complexity of the jewelry. A simple wedding band will always cost less than a three-stone engagement ring; there&amp;#39;s simply more to appraise with the latter.
A thorough appraisal will include:
laboratory work to inspect and gather facts about the piece
market research to compare like pieces
writing of the appraisal
Antique Jewelry Appraisals
Sometimes antique jewelry pieces or items with cultural significance may require an expert in that area. An appraiser that specializes in these areas may charge more for his or her services. Also, experienced appraisers who have been in business for a long time, may charge more, too, per pricescope.com.
Find a Jewelry Appraiser
The most important factor when seeking an accurate, reputable appraisal is the credentials of the appraiser. Check American Gem Society, the National Association of Jewelry Appraisers or Gemological Institute of America for a list of qualified appraisers.

When and How to Make a Ring Smaller Without Resizing

A proper fit for a ring is essential. Too loose and you risk losing it. Too tight and it&amp;#39;s uncomfortable and hard to remove.
When your ring doesn&amp;#39;t fit properly, your first thought is to get it resized.
Often, this is the safest, most permanent option. However, having your ring permanently resized is not always the best choice, and temporary solutions can be ideal under certain circumstances.
When Not to Resize Your Ring
If you suddenly find your ring spinning on your finger, your first step should be to pinpoint the root cause. Fingers can shrink for many reasons, many of them temporary, like cold weather or weight loss.
Also, consider the circumstances under which your ring was first fitted. Something obvious, like pregnancy, would cause your ring to fit more snugly at the time of fitting. But the culprit could also be something more unexpected and seemingly trivial, like a high-salt meal right before your sizing.
Maybe you&amp;#39;re just really sensitive to temperature fluctuations. If your ring size seems to go up and down with the mercury, a temporary ring adjuster is perfect.
Whether you need an interim solution until you reach your goal weight, or you need something you can take in and out indefinitely in accordance with the weather, read on to learn how to make a ring smaller without resizing.
Find out what size ring you actually need with a printable ring sizer.
Jeweler-Applied Ring Sizers
When you are considering getting your ring resized smaller by your jeweler, you likely think of a permanent reduction in the circumference of the band.
That&amp;#39;s not the only option, though. Since every resizing negatively affects the strength of the metal, it&amp;#39;s wise to consider adding to the ring instead, which maintains the integrity of the ring. Here are some jeweler-applied ring resizing options:
  Sizing Beads
To make your ring smaller using sizing beads, a jeweler simply adds two small metal balls on the back part of the inside of your ring.
Sizing beads are an economical way to reduce the size of your ring. They&amp;#39;re perfect for reducing a ring by one half-size and they&amp;#39;re great for keeping your ring upright on your finger.
Some wearers find them uncomfortable, which is the biggest downside. Ask your jeweler if they have an example ring with sizing beads for you to try on.
    Spring Insert
A spring insert is another easy way for a jeweler to resize your ring smaller, up to one full ring size.
Shaped like a horseshoe, a spring insert is a strip of metal that lines the bottom 3/4 of the inside of your band. Like its namesake, it springs open slightly to allow the ring past your knuckle and then springs back to fit snugly at the base of your finger.
This method is a little more complicated for the jeweler than sizing beads, but still an affordable choice. Wearers typically find a spring insert more comfortable, too.
    Fold-Over Device/Sizing Bar
If you don&amp;#39;t like the idea of consistently squeezing your finger through your ring to get it past your knuckle, a fold-over device is for you.
A jeweler can solder a U-shaped bar across the bottom of your ring, with a hinge on one side and a latch on the other. All you do is open the latch to put the ring on and swing it shut to hold it in place.
With this method, rings can be resized several full ring sizes smaller. Fold-over devices are typically reported as comfortable as well. See if your jeweler has a sample ring to try out.
    Do-It-Yourself Ring Sizers
If you&amp;#39;d prefer not to visit your jeweler or have an urgent need, there are ring sizers you can buy and apply yourself.
Plastic Guard
Widely available, plastic ring adjusters are a cheap, quick option to solve your ring size issue right away. They&amp;#39;re basically little silicone wedges or sleeves that sit between your ring and your finger. (We love BlingWraps by BlingGuard.)
They do work but can make your ring sit up awkwardly off your finger. They&amp;#39;re also much less reliable than something a jeweler solders on and they do have the risk of slipping out.
  Ring Sizers to Avoid
You might need a near-instant, cheap method to make your ring smaller. You might thus be tempted by DIY methods that involve adhering something to your ring.
We do not recommend using tape, liquid guard or food-grade silicone to make a ring smaller without resizing.
Adhering anything not specifically made for jewelry is asking for trouble. Gold and platinum are typically nonreactive, however many rings are alloyed with small amounts of other metals and those may not react as well. Your skin might not react well to the foreign substance, either.
  Some Parting Advice
If your ring isn&amp;#39;t fitting quite right, take it off, store it safely in a fabric pouch and take it to your jeweler. Their expert opinion will be able to tell you whether you should permanently resize your ring, have them apply an adjustable ring sizer like those previously discussed, or go with a plastic guard you can use as needed.
Always remember: The fewer times you resize your ring, the better. Each resize stretches and weakens the metal and eventually, you will increase your chances of damage or loss. (This is why many jewelers offer only one complimentary resize. They encourage customers to avoid resizing multiple times to maintain the integrity of the ring.)

(This is why many jewelers offer only one complimentary resize. They encourage customers to avoid resizing multiple times to maintain the integrity of the ring.)
Not sure what size ring you should be wearing? Download our printable ring sizer!
Having a ring that fits properly is a must, and so is jewelry insurance. Never worry about losing your jewelry again. Get a free jewelry insurance quote in a minute by filling out the form below. No personal information needed.

We are committed to protecting the privacy of information you entrust to us, and this policy describes how we do that.  This policy describes the personal information that we collect from you and how that information may be used or disclosed by us.  This policy does not apply to any subsidiary or affiliate of the Jewelers Mutual Group that maintains its own privacy policy. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.
Changes to our Privacy Policy
We may make changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time.  The date this Privacy Policy was last updated is identified at the top of the page. 
Information We Collect or Acquire
Depending upon the relationship you choose to have with us, we will collect an appropriate level of information about you.  The information we may gather and collect falls into three general categories: contact, personal, and financial.

You may provide us information about yourself when you buy a product from us, use our website or other applications, send us an application or claim form, enter a contest or promotion sponsored by us, visit our booth at trade shows and other events, participate in our sponsored webcasts, or communicate with us. If your insurance policy was obtained through a third party (such as an insurance agent), information may be provided to us by that third party on your behalf.
During the quoting, application or claims handling processes we collect such information as your name, postal address, email address, telephone number, and date of birth.  We may collect information about your transactions and experiences with us and others, such as your payment information, criminal background, claims, coverage and policy changes. We may also receive information about you from consumer reporting agencies, which provide us with your claims history and/or credit information where permitted by law.
If you provide us with information about individuals other than yourself, such as household members or business associates, you have obtained any consent required to share that person’s information under any applicable laws, rules, or regulations and have directed them to this Privacy Policy.
Information from Our Affiliates
We may obtain information about your transactions with our affiliates in accordance with applicable law.

It helps us to improve our services and to deliver better and more personalized services, including by enabling us to:
Estimate our audience and usage patterns;
Store information about your preferences, allowing us to customize our services according to your individual interests;
Speed up your searches; and
Recognize you when you return to our services.
The technologies we use for the automatic data collection may include:

Aggregated or De-identified Data

Right to access
You are entitled to a copy of your personal information we hold about you and to learn details about how we use it.  Your Information will usually be provided to you digitally.
Right to deletion
In certain circumstances, you have the right to ask us to delete your personal information.  For example, where your personal information that we collected is no longer necessary for the original purpose or where your personal information has become obsolete.  However, we will need to balance this against other factors.  For example, we may not be able to comply with your request due to certain legal or regulatory obligations.
You may request to exercise the foregoing rights by emailing us at privacy@jminsure.com or calling us at 877-238-5595.  Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a request related to your personal information. You must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information.

We will use reasonable measures to verify the identity of the requestor before processing a request.   We will respond to your request within 45 days.  If we require more time (up to 45 days), we will notify you of the reason and the extension period in writing.

How the Big Names Compare to the Experts
Jewelry is covered under typical renters and homeowners insurance policies. But that coverage is usually subject to a limit of a couple grand, and even a rider or floater has its limitations.
What&amp;#39;s covered?
All the most common dangers to rings. Loss, theft, damage and mysterious disappearance are covered.
 
It&amp;#39;s an all perils policy, so if it&amp;#39;s not listed as NOT covered, it&amp;#39;s covered.
Loss
You hide the ring in your golf bag, but it&amp;#39;s not there when you go to propose. Or you propose successfully and she misplaces it. It&amp;#39;s out there somewhere but you can&amp;#39;t find it. It&amp;#39;s covered.
Theft
Maybe your sketchy uncle has sticky fingers. Or your home gets broken into and they went straight for your sock drawer. You can rest assured that&amp;#39;s covered, too.
Damage
Your fiancée hits her shiny new ring on the edge of a table and it cracks, or a prong gets caught on a sweater and bent. Accidents happen. We&amp;#39;ll cover that.
Disappearance
Sometimes jewelry just disappears - it could be lost, stolen or hanging in a drainpipe somewhere. You may not be able to explain how, where or when it vanished. Don&amp;#39;t worry, that&amp;#39;s covered.
Worldwide Travel
All our policies extend worldwide, so know that you&amp;#39;re covered, no matter where your travels may take you.
War &amp;amp; Authority
Loss or damage due to war, military action, nuclear hazard or confiscation by civil authority, like law enforcement or other government entities, is not covered.
Deterioration
Damage from inherent defects or from typical wear and tear is not covered. (Think gradual, expected deterioration like small scratches on the underside of a ring.)
Intentional Actions
Purposely damaging or losing your jewelry won&amp;#39;t be covered. Fraud associated with voluntary parting isn&amp;#39;t either. If you sell your jewelry and the check bounces, that&amp;#39;s not included.
Critters
Damage from vermin, rodents or insects isn&amp;#39;t covered. So if a moth infestation affects the heirlooms in your attic, you couldn&amp;#39;t file a claim for that.

How the Big Names Compare to the Experts
Tell me more (5 Minute Read)
With your homeowners policy, you will typically get a check for the amount your jewelry is insured for. It will then be up to you to try to get something similar to what you had before.
With a Jewelers Mutual policy, one of our jewelry experts will connect you with your jeweler to find a same-kind-and-quality replacement for your jewelry. All the work behind-the-scenes is done for you by someone who specializes in the unique properties of fine jewelry.

What Jewelers Mutual Covers
All the most common dangers to jewelry. Loss, theft, damage and mysterious disappearance are covered.
 
It’s an all perils policy, so if it’s not listed as NOT covered, it’s covered.
Loss
You left your ring somewhere – on a beach towel or in a public bathroom. It’s out there somewhere but you can’t find it. It’s covered.
Theft
We all know that feeling of dread when something we cherish is stolen. But you can rest assured that your stolen piece is covered, too.
Damage
You hit your diamond ring on the edge of a table and it cracks, or you’re pulling on a sweater and a prong is bent. Accidents happen. We’ll cover that.
Disappearance
Sometimes jewelry just disappears – it could be lost, stolen or hanging out in a drainpipe somewhere. You may not be able to explain how, where or when it happened. Don’t worry, that’s covered.

Protecting All Things Jewelry Since 1913
Jewelry insurance is only as good as the company standing behind it. Protect yours with the only insurer in North America solely dedicated to jewelry insurance for over 100 years.
Read more about our history, awards, and partnerships.
What&amp;#39;s Covered
We provide all types of jewelry insurance, including engagement ring insurance. Watches, earrings, and even loose stones while being set - yep, we cover those too.
No matter the type of jewelry you insure, it&amp;#39;ll be protected by our comprehensive repair or replacement coverage. Plus, your coverage includes worldwide travel.
Loss
You left your ring somewhere—on a beach towel or in a public bathroom. It’s out there somewhere and you can’t find it. It’s covered.
Theft
We all know that feeling of dread when something we cherish is stolen. But you can rest assured that your stolen piece is covered, too.
Damage
You hit your diamond ring on the edge of a table and it cracks, or you&amp;#39;re pulling on a sweater and a prong is bent. Accidents happen. We&amp;#39;ll cover that.
Disappearance
Sometimes jewelry just disappears—it could be lost, stolen or hanging out in a drainpipe somewhere. You may not be able to explain how, where or when it vanished. Don’t worry, that’s covered.
Why Not Homeowners?
If you rely solely on your homeowners insurance, your jewelry will only be protected against specific causes of loss, usually up to a specified limit. If you add a jewelry rider, your coverage should include full replacement coverage against most causes of loss. But will you be satisfied at the end of a claim? And will your premium go up?
With a standalone repair and replacement policy, your claim starts with a jewelry expert who knows exactly what you need and ends with a same-kind-and-quality jewelry piece. It does not end with uncertainty about the potential to lose (or pay more for) your home&amp;#39;s insurance, just because of a claim on your jewelry. See our FAQ for more information.
Check Your Rate
Estimate your rate in less than one minute. Just tell us what you need to insure, how much it’s worth and your zip/postal code.

How it All Works
1
Estimate Your Rate
Tell us what you need to insure, how much it’s worth, and where you live and estimate your rate (with different options for deductibles) in less than one minute.
2
Apply For Coverage
Tell us a bit more about yourself and your jewelry and, in most cases, your coverage starts immediately. If someone else actually wears the jewelry, tell us about them too.
3
Wear Your Jewelry, Worry Free
Rest assured that your jewelry is protected. And if something does happen, you’ll get to work directly with your jeweler to repair or replace your piece, exactly like it was before.
4
File a Claim
This is where you tell us what happened. Then you visit your jeweler to arrange for repairs or a replacement. Once you agree your jewelry&amp;#39;s good as new, you pay your deductible (if you chose one), and the jeweler bills us for the rest, up to your policy limit.

How the Big Names Compare to the Experts
Jewelry is covered under typical renters and homeowners insurance policies. But that coverage is usually subject to a limit of a couple grand, and even a rider or floater has its limitations.
What&amp;#39;s covered?
All the most common dangers to earrings (and other jewelry). Loss, theft, damage and mysterious disappearance are covered.
 
It&amp;#39;s an all perils policy, so if it&amp;#39;s not listed as NOT covered, it&amp;#39;s covered.
Damage
You drop your diamond earring on the edge of a table and it cracks, or the post gets caught and breaks. Accidents happen. We’ll cover that.
Disappearance
Sometimes jewelry just disappears – it could be lost, stolen or hanging out in a drainpipe somewhere. You may not be able to explain how, where or when it happened. Don’t worry, that’s covered.
Loss
You take your earrings off at the gym and can’t find them after. Or you swear you put them on the counter to shower, but they&amp;#39;re gone. They&amp;#39;re out there somewhere but you can’t find them. They&amp;#39;re covered.
Theft
Maybe your sketchy uncle has sticky fingers. Or your home gets broken into and they went straight for your jewelry box. You can rest assured that&amp;#39;s covered, too.
Worldwide Travel
All our policies extend worldwide, so know that you&amp;#39;re covered, no matter where your travels may take you.
Critters
Damage from vermin, rodents or insects isn&amp;#39;t covered. So if a moth infestation affects the heirlooms in your attic, you couldn&amp;#39;t file a claim for that.
Deterioration
Damage from inherent defects or from typical wear and tear is not covered. (Think gradual, expected deterioration.)
Intentional Actions
Purposely damaging or losing your earrings won’t be covered. Fraud associated with voluntary parting isn’t either. If you sell your earrings and the check bounces, that’s not included.
War &amp;amp; Authority
Loss or damage due to war, military action, nuclear hazard or confiscation by civil authority, like law enforcement or other government entities, is not covered.

Estimate your rate in less than one minute. Just tell us what you need to insure, how much it’s worth and your zip/postal code.

What&amp;#39;s covered?
All the most common dangers to watches (and other jewelry). Loss, theft, damage and mysterious disappearance are covered.
 
It&amp;#39;s an all perils policy, so if it&amp;#39;s not listed as NOT covered, it&amp;#39;s covered.
Damage
You hit the face of your watch on the edge of a table and it cracks, or the clasp gets caught and breaks. Accidents happen. We’ll cover that.
Disappearance
Sometimes jewelry just disappears – it could be lost, stolen or hanging out in a drainpipe somewhere. You may not be able to explain how, where or when it happened. Don’t worry, that’s covered.
Loss
You take your watch off at the gym and can’t find it after. Or you swear you put it on the counter to shower, but it’s gone. It’s out there somewhere but you can’t find it. It’s covered.
Theft
Maybe your sketchy uncle has sticky fingers. Or your home gets broken into and they went straight for your sock drawer. You can rest assured that&amp;#39;s covered, too.
Worldwide Travel
All our policies extend worldwide, so know that you&amp;#39;re covered, no matter where your travels may take you.
Critters
Damage from vermin, rodents or insects isn&amp;#39;t covered. So if a moth infestation affects the heirlooms in your attic, you couldn&amp;#39;t file a claim for that.
Deterioration
Damage from inherent defects or from typical wear and tear is not covered. (Think gradual, expected deterioration like small scratches on case of a watch.)
Intentional Actions
Purposely damaging or losing your watch won’t be covered. Fraud associated with voluntary parting isn’t either. If you sell your watch and the check bounces, that’s not included.

How the Big Names Compare to the Experts
Jewelry, like smartwatches, is covered under typical renters and homeowners insurance policies. But that coverage is usually subject to a limit of a couple grand, and even a rider or floater has its limitations.
What&amp;#39;s covered?
All the most common dangers to smartwatches. Loss, theft, damage and mysterious disappearance are covered.
 
It&amp;#39;s an all perils policy, so if it&amp;#39;s not listed as NOT covered, it&amp;#39;s covered.
Damage
You hit the face of your watch on the edge of a table and it cracks, or the clasp gets caught and breaks. Accidents happen. We’ll cover that.
Disappearance
Sometimes stuff just disappears – it could be lost, stolen or hanging out in a drainpipe somewhere. You may not be able to explain how, where or when it happened. Don’t worry, that’s covered.
Loss
You take your watch off at the gym and can’t find it after. Or you swear you put it on the counter to shower, but it’s gone. It’s out there somewhere but you can’t find it. It’s covered.
Theft
Maybe your sketchy uncle has sticky fingers. Or your home gets broken into and they went straight for your sock drawer. You can rest assured that&amp;#39;s covered, too.
Worldwide Travel
All our policies extend worldwide, so know that you&amp;#39;re covered, no matter where your travels may take you.
Virus or Programming Error
Loss or damage because of any viruses or programming errors or malfunctions is not covered.
Deterioration &amp;amp; Obsolescence
Damage from inherent defects or from typical wear and tear is not covered. You also cannot recoup any lost value due to advancements in technology.
Intentional Actions
Purposely damaging or losing your watch won’t be covered. Fraud associated with voluntary parting isn’t either. If you sell your watch and the check bounces, that’s not included.
Data &amp;amp; Software
Any personalized data or customized software, like contact lists, messages, photos or apps, is not covered.
Get a FreeQuote
Rates depend on where you live. But for most people, jewelry insurance costs 1-2% of the value of their jewelry.
For example, a $10,000 ring costs about $100 per year to insure.

Your engagement ring might be the first piece of fine jewelry you own. After the initial excitement of being engaged winds down, you suddenly realize you’re now responsible for a valuable piece of jewelry - one that you need to care for every single day.
It&amp;#39;s easy to panic - wondering how often to clean your diamond to keep it sparkling, when to take off your engagement ring and how to keep your new jewelry safe. 
Start with these daily, weekly and yearly tasks. If you do each of these things at the frequency noted, you’re very likely to have a diamond that really does last forever. 
How to Care for Your Diamond Engagement Ring Daily
Store in a separate, fabric pouch or section of your jewelry box
One of the most common ways jewelry is damaged is being scratched by other jewelry.
Have a safe, memorable location available to place your jewelry
Even when you’re on-the-go, always know where you can safely store your ring if you need to remove it.
Watch for warning signs of vulnerabilities in your jewelry
Know how to spot a loose stone. There are six major signs that your jewelry’s about to break.
Place your ring in a designated spot while showering
All those soaps and shampoos will cause buildup on your ring. Plus, fishing a ring out of the drain is never fun!
Wipe down with a dry gem cloth
Need your very own gem cloth? Ask your jeweler or let us know!
How to Care for Your Diamond Engagement Ring Weekly
A light cleaning using a safe, homemade jewelry cleaner
Sweat and body oil can dull the shine of your jewelry. The best DIY diamond ring cleaner calls for just warm soapy water and a fresh toothbrush. Watch the video to the right to learn how to clean diamond rings.
How to Care for Your Diamond Engagement Ring Yearly
Professional Cleaning and Inspection
It&amp;#39;s easy to lose a piece of jewelry or individual stones if you&amp;#39;re not giving your jewelry regular check-ups. Your jeweler will deep clean your pieces for a brilliant shine, too! Two times per year is best. 
Renew Your Jewelry Insurance
Make sure you fully understand your coverage. Not covered? Get a quote.
Get an Updated Appraisal
If your jewelry&amp;#39;s value has decreased, you could be spending more than necessary to insure your piece. Or, the reverse could mean you&amp;#39;re underinsured and may incur additional out-of-pocket expense to repair or replace jewelry that becomes damaged or lost. Getting a new jewelry appraisal every 2-3 years is suﬃcient.
Never Do This to Your Diamond Engagement Ring
Clean your jewelry with bleach, abrasives or toothpaste
Strong chemicals like bleach can discolor precious metals, and abrasives like toothpaste and baking soda can scratch softer stones and metals.
Pick your ring up by the stone
The less often you handle your ring, the better, especially the center stone.
Put your jewelry in a storage unit
Rent a safety deposit box at your bank if you&amp;#39;re moving or need to store your jewelry away from your home for an extended period.
When to Take Your Engagement Ring Off
Although you may not want to, there are certain times when it is best to take your engagement ring off and store it in a safe place.
When washing hands, keep in mind that soaps or sanitizers may be harmful to certain stones and metals. In addition, cool water can cause your fingers to shrink, creating room for your ring to slip off. In general, rings and open drains are a risky combo which is why it’s best to remove the ring before washing.
The activities below can cause damage to the band or stone of your ring or unnecessarily subject your piece to loss or theft. 
Gardening
Dirt and small rocks are abrasive. If not cleaned right away, your jewelry can be permanently damaged. Beware the dangers of gardening gloves too.
Cleaning
Bleach and other heavy-duty cleaners can wear away at precious metals.
Exercise
Any exercise that requires you to hold something, like dumbbells, a tennis racket or golf clubs, is a jewelry wearing no-no. Sweat in general can also be damaging to sterling silver.
Swimming or Hot Tubbing
Salt water and chlorine can damage your jewelry. Chlorine can discolor metals (like gold and platinum) and can slowly erode the finish and polish of gemstones. It can even corrode your prongs enough for them to break off entirely. Plus, the cold water could make your fingers constrict, causing the ring to become loose and fall off.
Cooking
Things get messy in the kitchen. Take off your ring to avoid coating it with sauce or nicking it with a knife.
Applying Lotions or Sprays
Lotion can get into the crevices of chains and prongs, and both lotions and sprays create a film on your jewelry, making it dull and dingy.
Set a Reminder
While all these tasks may seem daunting to remember, it’s really all about habits.
Make it a habit to always remove your ring when doing something potentially damaging. When in doubt, take it off - just be sure to designate safe storage spaces both home and on-the-go. 
As for the maintenance tasks like cleaning, inspections and appraisals, try setting yourself recurring calendar reminders. If your jewelry is insured, your annual policy renewal is a great reminder to take that ring in for an inspection!
If your ring is not insured (gasp!), click the button below to get a quote in minutes and see how affordable peace of mind really is.

How the Big Names Compare to the Experts
Jewelry is typically covered under renters and homeowners insurance policies. But that coverage is not usually enough to cover
the full replacement cost, and even a jewelry-specific rider added to your homeowners policy has its limits.
Protecting All Things Jewelry Since 1913
Jewelry insurance is only as good as the company standing behind it. Protect yours with the only insurer in North America solely dedicated to jewelry insurance for over 100 years.
More about our history
What&amp;#39;s Covered
We provide all types of jewelry insurance, including engagement ring insurance. Watches, earrings, and even loose stones while being set - yep, we cover those too.
No matter the type of jewelry you insure, it&amp;#39;ll be protected by our comprehensive repair or replacement coverage. Plus, your coverage includes worldwide travel.
Loss
You left your ring somewhere—on a beach towel or in a public bathroom. It’s out there somewhere and you can’t find it. It’s covered.
Theft
We all know that feeling of dread when something we cherish is stolen. But you can rest assured that your stolen piece is covered, too.
Damage
You hit your diamond ring on the edge of a table and it cracks, or you&amp;#39;re pulling on a sweater and a prong is bent. Accidents happen. We&amp;#39;ll cover that.
Disappearance
Sometimes jewelry just disappears—it could be lost, stolen or hanging out in a drainpipe somewhere. You may not be able to explain how, where or when it vanished. Don’t worry, that’s covered.

Why Jewelers Mutual?
Jewelers Mutual is the only insurer in North America solely dedicated to jewelry insurance for over 100 years. 
We don&amp;#39;t insure cars or houses or fancy purebred dogs. We insure jewelry and only jewelry.
We are the jewelry insurance experts.
 
What Makes Us Different
We don’t just cut a check and run like most insurance companies. If you file a claim, you’ll walk away with a piece that’s the same kind and the same quality as the one you had.
We’re obsessed with jewelry.
Our staff includes GIA Graduate Gemologists, AGS Certified Gemologists and experience in the jewelry industry. When we say we’re jewelry experts, we mean it.
You choose your own jeweler.
When it’s time for repair or replacement, we work with your trusted jeweler. We don’t pick one for you (but we can help you find one). 
We cover worldwide travel.
While coverage is only available to residents of the US and Canada, you can travel worldwide without worry. Because who doesn’t have a little wanderlust in them?
Hassle free claims experience.
In the unfortunate event you suffer jewelry damage or loss, you can expect a fast, professional, compassionate repair or replacement experience.
We probably cover more than your homeowners or renters insurance.
Most homeowners policies don’t cover loss, disappearance, damage, earthquakes, or floods. Get comprehensive coverage with a standalone policy that won’t leave you hanging.
We&amp;#39;re not nearly as expensive as you might think.
Jewelry insurance rates depend on several factors – including where you live – but in many cases, annual coverage could cost roughly 1-2% of your jewelry’s value. 
A claim won’t make your homeowners or renters insurance rates go up.
If your jewelry is only covered under your homeowners or renters insurance, and you file a claim with them, your rate could go up for your entire homeowners or renters policy.
Comparing Jewelry Insurance and a Homeowners Policy
When you add jewelry to your homeowners policy, you will typically get a check for the amount your jewelry is insured for. It will then be up to you to try to get something similar to what you had before.
With a Jewelers Mutual policy, one of our jewelry experts will connect you with your jeweler to find a same-kind-and-quality replacement. All the work behind-the-scenes is done for you by someone who specializes in the unique properties of fine jewelry. 
A jewelry claim filed against your homeowners policy could affect your entire policy. So, if your jewelry was ever stolen or lost, your premium could go up or your eligibility for your entire homeowners policy could be affected at renewal. A standalone jewelry insurance policy keeps your small, easily misplaced valuables separate from your home and the rest of your belongings.
Insurance Value Adjustment: Keeping You Fully Covered
After you insure your jewelry on your homeowners policy, you&amp;#39;ll likely set it and forget it. The market value of your jewelry changes over time, while the amount you’ve insured it for stays the same.
Jewelers Mutual specializes in jewelry and understands the jewelry market. We have a yearly Insurance Value Adjustment (IVA) in place to help ensure your coverage matches what it would actually cost to replace your jewelry in today&amp;#39;s market. This is basically a percentage increase in your coverage limit (and consequently, your premium) meant to keep you from being underinsured. You can also provide an updated appraisal for the greatest accuracy, or you can opt-out of this feature all together.
 
Get a Free Quote
Rates depend on where you live. But for most people, jewelry insurance costs 1-2% of the value of their jewelry.
For example, a $10,000 ring costs about $100 per year to insure.

ESTIMATE MY RATE
Repair or Replacement Coverage vs. Reimbursement
Many traditional insurance policies simply reimburse you for the cost to repair or replace your lost or damaged jewelry with “like kind and quality.” In these cases, you’re left to deal not only with the emotional toll of losing a sentimental symbol, but also the stress of trying to get an equal replacement for your original piece.
With a repair or replacement policy, like Jewelers Mutual’s, we step in for you and deal directly with your jeweler of choice. You don’t have to worry about explaining every detail of your original piece to help the jeweler recreate an exact match. Our jewelry claim professionals will collaborate with your jeweler to make sure that your piece is repaired to your satisfaction or replaced with a piece that’s the same kind and quality.
“What if my tastes have changed or I want to upgrade?”
In either case, the jeweler can simply invoice us for the cost to replace what you had, and you can choose something of equal value or pay the difference if you want something more expensive.
   
What Jewelers Mutual Covers
While some insurance policies may only cover jewelry theft, we cover real life. We realize you can’t always pinpoint how or where your jewelry disappeared, so we cover mysterious disappearance – a coverage often overlooked by other carriers. Jewelry that’s loved and worn doesn&amp;#39;t stay pristine, either. So if your jewelry gets damaged, that&amp;#39;s covered too.
Loss
You left your ring somewhere – on a beach towel or in a public bathroom. It’s out there somewhere but you can’t find it. It’s covered.
Theft
We all know that feeling of dread when something we cherish is stolen. But you can rest assured that your stolen piece is covered, too.
Damage
You hit your diamond ring on the edge of a table and it cracks, or you’re pulling on a sweater and a prong is bent. Accidents happen. We’ll cover that.
Disappearance
Sometimes jewelry just disappears – it could be lost, stolen or hanging out in a drainpipe somewhere. You may not be able to explain how, where or when it happened. Don’t worry, that’s covered.
Loose Stones
Our policy also covers loose stones, including while they are being set by your jeweler. This coverage is not found in all insurance policies.
Worldwide Travel
We are available to residents in the United States and Canada*. While the home address of both the jewelry wearer and applicant need to be in the United States or Canada*, our coverage does travel with you worldwide. You can jet-set across the globe and not have to worry about wearing your favorite jewelry.
*Coverage not available in Québec.
Insurance Coverage Limits
Many insurance policies not specifically designed for jewelry have a reimbursement limit. For example, a policy might only pay up to $1,000 for jewelry claims, regardless of the value of the piece. Consequently, you would have to pay the difference out-of-pocket to get an equal replacement.
At Jewelers Mutual, your coverage limit is customized based on the value documentation you provide for your jewelry items. (This is why having a recent appraisal is so important!) 
Jewelry Insurance Cost
You just bought brand new, sparkly jewelry. So, naturally, you&amp;#39;re super excited to talk about insurance, right? Yeah, that&amp;#39;s what we thought.  But, it&amp;#39;s really important. And it&amp;#39;s not as expensive as everyone thinks it is.
  WHAT WILL IT COST ME?
How Much Does Jewelry Insurance Cost?
Rates are based on several factors, including where you live. But for most people, jewelry insurance will cost 1-2% of the value of their jewelry. For example, a $5,000 engagement ring could cost as little as $50 per year to insure.
To put that in perspective, jewelry insurance can cost less than getting one coffee every month for a year. We think protecting your jewelry is worth it!

Insurance Claims Experience
At the end of the day, you have insurance so you can file a claim when you need to. While we certainly hope you don’t experience the damage or loss of your treasured jewelry, we are here to help if you do. Follow the below steps in the event of a claim.
 
1
Start Your Claim
Let us know what happened.
Start your claim online, or call us at 888-884-2424.
2
Choose a Jeweler
Choose a jeweler to repair or replace your item.
Once you get the okay from us, head to your jeweler. If you&amp;#39;re not sure who to use, we can help find a jeweler near you.
3
Pay Your Deductible
If your policy has a deductible, pay that amount to your jeweler.
The jeweler will bill us for the rest. (If you have a $0 deductible, and the cost of replacement isn&amp;#39;t more than you insured yours for, you pay nothing. All you have to do is pick up your jewelry, good as new!)
4
Insure Your Replacement Jewelry
If your jewelry was replaced entirely, we&amp;#39;ll help you add that to your policy.
If your jewelry was simply repaired back to its original state, there&amp;#39;s nothing more for you to do!
What&amp;#39;s Needed During a Claim
When your jewelry is damaged, lost or stolen, all you want is to get it back, just the way it was. To help us get you there as fast as possible, prepare the following before you start your claim. If any additional documentation is needed, your claims representative will let you know.
Proof of Ownership
Any documentation, like a receipt, appraisal or dated photo of the jewelry, that proves it&amp;#39;s yours.
Written Statement
A short statement explaining what happened, including a list of damage if your jewelry wasn&amp;#39;t lost or stolen entirely.
Police Report (in select cases)
A police report, depending on the jewelry and how it was lost or stolen. We&amp;#39;ll let you know if it&amp;#39;s needed.
